# Unexpected Tezos DeFi Hackathon involvement

## Introduction
The story began with my exploration of the ethereum ecosystem, where I delved into official documentation and wrote basic smart contracts. While browsing ForkLog, I stumbled upon an article about a blockchain tezos hackathon and gained access to the accompanying slack platform.

Although I had the option to create my own team, I lacked sufficient experience and thus sought to join an existing one. After several days of searching, I received a few offers but none seemed dependable, so I turned them down.

With the hackathon looming the next day and no team in sight, I began to lose hope. However, I received a promising invitation from a group of individuals who had a fantastic idea to create a randomized NFT marketplace. I accepted their offer and together, we named our team "the Buttonists".

Our project's concept involved a button on the website that allowed users to place bets using cryptocurrency. To outbid others, participants were required to offer more crypto than the previous bidder, and the individual who placed the highest bid would ultimately emerge as the winner.

## Day D

At the start of our day, we held a planning meeting where we assigned roles. My responsibilities involved modifying the NFT minter and designing the user interface, which was an unfamiliar and demanding task for me. With minimal documentation and only 26 hours of work, we had to improvise and work under tight deadlines.

However, just in time for the presentation, we managed to complete the application and present our NFT marketplace prototype. Our managers did an excellent job of creating an outstanding product and presentation.

After seeing the strength of the other teams' projects during the presentation, we were very anxious. However, to our surprise, we emerged as the winners in the end.
