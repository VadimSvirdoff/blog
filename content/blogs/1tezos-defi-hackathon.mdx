# Unexpected Tezos DeFi Hackathon involvement

## Introduction

The story started from the investigation of the ethereum ecosystem. I started dealing with official documentation and writing simple smart contracts. 

One day on ForkLog I found an article about the blockchain tezos hackathon. I got an access  to the slack. 

There was an option to create a team by myself, but I hadn't a lot of experience, so I decided to look for it. Few days I was looking for a team, there were few proposals, but It was not very reliable, so I rejected them.

The day before the hackathon I still was without a team, and lost last hope, but got a very perspective invitation from guys who had a very amazing idea, implement a randomized NFT marketplace.

We decided to name our team **the Buttonists**

## Day D

We started our day with planning meeting. Firstly we assigned roles, my duties were to modify the NFT minter and create the user interface.

It was a real challenging task, because I have never done it before. We did everything on the go, we really haven't a lot of documentation, but after 26 hours of work just before the presentation, we completed the application.

Finally, we finished the NFT marketplace prototype. Our managers created the awesome product and plan presentations.

After the presentation, we were so nervous because the project of other teams were so strong.

In the end, we found out that we won.
