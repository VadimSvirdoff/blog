# Unexpected Tezos DeFi Hackathon involvement

## Introduction

The story started from the investigation of the ethereum ecosystem. I started dealing with official documentation and writing simple smart contracts. 

One day on ForkLog I found an article about the blockchain tezos hackathon. I registered and connected to the slack. 

There was an option to create a team by myself, but I hadn't a lot of experience, so I decided to look for it. Few days I was looking for a team, there were few proposals, but It was not very reliable, so I rejected them.

The day before the hackathon I still without a team, and lost last hope, but got a very perspective invitation from gays who had a so amazing idea, implement a randomized NFT marketplace.

We decided to name our team **the Buttonists**

## Day D

The day we started from a planning meeting. Firstly we assigned roles, my duties were to modify the NFT minter and create the user interface.

It was a really challenging task, because before I never do it before. We did everything on the go, we really haven't a lot of documentation, but after 26 hours of work just before the presentation, we completed the application.

The result of our work is a working prototype of the NFT marketplace and two prized places in different domains.
