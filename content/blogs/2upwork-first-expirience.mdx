# Upwork first expirience

## Introduction

Each of us dreams of our own business. But how can we reach an unattainable goal?

From a developer's perspective, there are few ways.

- Find an enthusiastic team with a cool idea and a lot of experience and create a start-up

- Have money for creating your product

- Or find someone who needs a business partner

I haven't a lot of start-up ideas and a strong team, also I haven't a lot of money, so I decided to look for a partner.

The best way to find a partner is to find it on Upwork. This marketplace allows you to find projects and partners in different domains.

I started with account verification and my account development. I found the upwork guide which was very helpful. 

Account development includes such steps:

- Bio section
- Specialized account
- Portfolio
- Cover letter

The next step was looking for a project. I spent a lot of my time to find a good one.

Most parts of the projects were not very suitable. My goal was to find a customer with his great idea.

Say middleman no ðŸ˜†

## Let's rock it

After hundreds of propositions, I found a customer with a project that fit my expectations. The project goal was to create a chart for a Steam shop related store. The task was easy to create a chart with dynamic lines that change position related to a center point value.

I started from libraries researching. I took each library and instigated all parameters that we could use for chart line controlling. The results were not so happy, any of them was not suitable for our purposes. So I show the results to the customer, and we decided to develop a library from scratch.

There are few technologies suitable for charts development:

- SVG
- HTML
- Canvas

After investigation, I selected SVG.

## Why SVG?

The SVG image format isnâ€™t just for icons or simple images. It has advantages that apply to making charts, too. 

The formatâ€™s general advantages like this:

- Small file sizes that compress well
- Scales to any size without losing clarity (except very tiny sizes)
- Looks great on retina displays
- Design control like interactivity and filters

We can update this with two more key points that are useful for charts:

- SVGs are accessible to screen readers (with a little bit of work)
- There are plenty of SVG-based chart frameworks out there to help

Also, I had the related library contribution experience.ðŸ˜…

## Brief

The application includes such features:

- Point (sync to multiplier)
- Start phase (started from the left bottom corner to center)
- Final phase (started from the center to right bottom corner)
- Dynamic lines (lines value/position sync to point value)
- Background (sync to point value)
