# Upwork first expirience

## Introduction

Each of us dreams our self business. But how can we reach an unattainable goal?

From developer perspective there are few ways.

- Find enthuziastic team with cool idea and a lot of expirience and create start up

- Have money for creating your own product

- Or find someone who needs business partner

I haven't a lot start up ideas and strong team, also I haven't a lot of money, so I decided to look for a partner.

The best way to find partner is find it on upwork. This marketplace allows you to find project and partners in diffrent domains.

I started from the account verification, I found the upwork guide and started to develop my account. 

It include such steps:

- Bio section
- Specialized account
- Portfolio
- Cover letter

Next step was looking for a project. I spent a lot of my time to find a good one.

The biggest part of projects were not very suitable. My goal was find castomer with his own idea.
